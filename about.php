            <p>WebNEWS is an open source website where you can easily share news with a large community of people. It also provides you a platform where you can show your amazing blog writing skills to the world.</p>
            <p class="text-muted">It has been built using PHP as the server-side language and MYSQL as the database. It is completely open source and you are free to download the source code and use it in your own projects. The upcoming versions of this website would contain stuffs like user authentication where the user can log in and edit or delete their posts. There would also be a section where visitors can filter out the category of articles they would like to read. So, those of you who are intrested can collaborate with me on this project, simply drop me a mail at: <a href="#">kumarshashwat62@gmail.com</a></p>
            <p>WebNEWS has been designed and developed by Kumar Shashwat. He is a full stack web developer and currently an undergraduate engineering student.</p>
